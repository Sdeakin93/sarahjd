Starling Bank

When I joined Starling in 2017, I joined as a member of the customer service team - I moved then into events marketing, then to SEO, and into my current role as a web developer. Having a variety of roles at Starling has allowed me to work amongst different teams, and get a much wider understanding of the entire company. I understand our customers, and their needs from our website. I work every day in JS, with a focus on React, and working with Gatsby.

Starling is a UK-based digital bank, disrupting the financial services industry. Founded in 2014 by Anne Boden, it was granted a banking licence by the Bank of England in July 2016 and launched its first mobile personal current account in May 2017 available as a mobile app for both iOS and Android phones.
